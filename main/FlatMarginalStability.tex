\begin{abstract}
We study localized structures in a modified version of the Swift-Hohenberg equation with a flattened marginal stability curve. An amplitude equation is derived near the degeneracy that flattens the marginal stability curve. Numerical continuation shows an interconnected cascade of localized structures with a very regular pattern.
