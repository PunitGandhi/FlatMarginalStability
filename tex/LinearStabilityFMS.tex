\section{Linear Stability of the trivial solution}

For the modified Swift Hohenberg equation (Eq.~\ref{eq:flatSH}), the linear growth rate in time $\sigma$ of a perturbation with wavenumber $k$ about $u=0$ is given by
\begin{equation}
\sigma= r -\left(1-k^2\right)^4.
\end{equation}
The marginal stability curve that gives the critical value of the parameter $r$ where a perturbation of wavenumber $k$ makes the transition from stable to unstable in time is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:margstaba}.  By varying $\alpha$ of Eq.~\ref{eq:homSH} from 0 to 1, we smoothly transition from pure quartic curve to a pure quadratic curve as is also indicated from this figure.

By decreasing $\beta$ of Eq.~\ref{eq:collSH} from positive value to 0, on the other hand, we see the quartic curve form from the collision of two quadratic minima (Fig.~\ref{fig:margstabb}).
